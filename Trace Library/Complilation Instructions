This archive should contain three files: "test.cpp", "tracelib.h", and "Makefile".

tracelib.h is the library of trace library functions and their (inline) implementations.
test.cpp is a very simple program to show off how the trace library's functions behave.
Makefile is self-explanatory.

To compile the program, either use the "make" command or the following compilation instructions:
	g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test
This should produce a file called test. Simply run it now to generate a trace.json.
